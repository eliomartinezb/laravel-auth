Almost every project needs to have authentication even-though laravel makes it easier, I wanted to have this solved. Instead of making it everytime I start a project. Hope it helps someone else.

This is the scaffold of authorization that uses Laravel as the backend, Vue as the frontend and the frontend is an SPA.

## How to run the code

1. ```git clone``` repo.
2. ```npm install```.
3. ```composer install```
4. configure db.
   1. Create ```.env``` file 
   2. Fill information for database
5. ```php artisan passport:install```
6. Enjoy
